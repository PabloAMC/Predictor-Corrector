Yinyu Ye, Michael J. Todd and Shinji Mizuno algorithm "An O(âˆšn L)-Iteration Homogeneous and Self-Dual Linear Programming Algorithm"

This code runs the algorithm indicated in the title, solving a Linear Programming problem. The termination of the algorithm proposed in the original article is not implemented.
The plot is specific to the indicated example, changing it would require changing the functions f1, f2...
